# Journal (Core Data) Day 2

## Introduction

Today you will take the Journal project you made yesterday and add more functionality to it. This will help you practice migrating data in Core Data and `NSFetchedResultsController`.

Please look at the screen recording below to know what the finished project should look like:

## Instructions

Use the Journal project you made yesterday. Create a new branch called `day2`. When you finish today's instructions and go to make a pull request, be sure to select the original repository's `day2` branch as the base branch, and your own `day2` branch as the compare branch.

### Part 1 - Mood Feature

#### Segmented Control Addition

In order to add the functionality seen in the screen recording, which is the ability to set your mood: 

1. Add a `UISegmentedControl` to the `EntryDetailViewController` scene. 
2. Make 3 segments.
3. Set each segment's title to a mood. In the example screen recording, it uses happy, sad, and neutral emoji for the three moods, but you can choose anything you want.
4. Make an outlet from the segmented control to the view controller's class file.

#### Data Model Updates and Migration

Now, you will update your Core Data model to include a property to hold the mood that the user selects on the segmented control.

1. Select your Core Data data model file. In the menu, select Editor -> Add Model Version (keep it the same name and click the "Finish" button.
2. In the new data model file, add a new attribute called `mood`. Set its type to be `String`. 
3. Give the `mood` a default value. In the example, the default value is üòê, the neutral emoji. Again, you can choose whichever 3 moods you want. Just make sure to set the default value of this attribute to one of them.  This will allow the `Entry` objects that have been created before `mood` was added to have an initial value. 
4. In the File Inspector with the data model file selected, set the current model version to the new model version you just created. (It should be something like `Journal 2`)
5. Now navigate to your "Entry+Convenience.swift" file where you have the `Entry` extension and convenience initializer. Update the initializer to include and property initialize the new `mood` property.
6. Update your "Create" `EntryController` method to call the updated `Entry` initializer
7. Update your "Update" `EntryController` method to include a `mood` String parameter so the entry's `mood` can also be updated.

You will need to update the `EntryDetailViewController` in order for the mood to get saved (or updated) to an entry.

1. In the `EntryDetailViewController`'s save entry action (where you call the "Create" and "Update" CRUD methods), check which segment is selected and create a string constant that holds the corresponding mood.
    - **NOTE:** There are a few ways to go about this. You can use the `selectedSegmentIndex` propery of the segmented control to get the currently selected segment. From there, you can either create a conditional statement that will set the constant's value based on the `selectedSegmentIndex`. You could also use the `titleForSegment(at: Int)` method if the text in each segment is exactly what your moods are going to be. 
    - Remember that you're dealing with strings here. Now would be a perfect time to create an enum with a case for each of your three moods. You can add string raw values to each case that holds the mood string. This will help you make sure that you're using the same three strings anywhere in the application.
2. Still in the save entry action, you will need to update the "Create" and "Update" method calls to include the mood string you just made.
3. In the `updateViews()` method, set the segmented control's `selectedSegmentIndex` based on the entry's `mood` property. Doing this programmatically will cause the segmented control have the entry's corresponding mood segment selected to the user.

At this point, take the time to test your project. Make sure that:

- Entries that you have saved before adding the `mood` property have a default `mood` value added to them.
- The segmented control in the detail view controller selects the correct mood of an entry that you view when seguing to it.
- Moods get saved correctly to entries, both newly created and updated.

#### Part 2 - NSFetchedResultsController Implementation

You will now implement an `NSFetchedResultsController` to manage displaying entries on and handling interactions with the table view.

##### EntryController

1. Delete or comment out the `loadFromPersistentStore` method, and the `entries` array in the `EntryController`. The fetched results controller will manage performing fetch requests and giving data to the table view now.

##### EntriesTableViewController

1. In the `EntriesTableViewController`, create a lazy stored property called `fetchedResultsController`. Its type should be `NSFetchedResultsController<Entry>`. It should be initialized using a closure. Inside the closure:
    - Create a fetch request from the `Entry` object.
    - Create a sort descriptor that will sort the entries based on their `timestamp`. This can be either ascending or descending depending on your preference.
    - Give the sort descriptor to the fetch request's `sortDescriptors` property. Note that this property's type is an array of sort descriptors, not a single one.
    - Create a constant that references your core data stack's `mainContext`.
    - Create a constant and initialize an `NSFetchedResultsController` using the fetch request and managed object context. For the `sectionNameKeyPath`, put "mood" (exactly how you spelled it in the data model file), and `nil` for `cacheName`.
    - Set this view controller class as the delegate of the fetched results controller. **NOTE:** Xcode will give you an error, but you will fix it in just a second.
    - Perform the fetch request using the fetched results controller
    - Return the fetched results controller.
2. Adopt the `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` protocol in this view controller.
3. Add the following delegate methods to the table view controller:
    - `controllerWillChangeContent`.
    - `controllerDidChangeContent`.
    - `didChange sectionInfo` ... `atSectionIndex`.
    - `didChange anObject` ... `at indexPath`.

Remember that the implementation of these methods is going to be the same in most cases. You can use the implementations created in this morning's guided project. 

Now you will change the `UITableViewDataSource` methods to look to the fetched results controller for information about how to set up the table view instead of the (no longer existing) `entries` array in the `EntryController`.

4. Add the `numberOfSections(in tableView: ...)` method if you don't have it already. This should use the number of sections in the fetched results controller's `sections` array.
5. In the `numberOfRowsInSection`, Again, use the `section` parameter to get the section currently being set up to return the `numberOfObjects`.
6. In the `cellForRowAt`, use the fetched results controller's `object(at: IndexPath)` method to get the correct entry corresponding to the cell instead of using the `entries` array in the `EntryController.
7. In the `commit editingStyle`, use the `object(at: IndexPath)` method again to get the correct entry to be deleted instead of using the `entries` array in the `EntryController.
8. Use the same `object(at: IndexPath)` method in the `prepare(for segue: ...)` method to get the correct entry instead of using the `entries` array in the `EntryController.

## Introduction

For today's project, you will update Journal to update its Core Data data from the server in the background. This will allow you to practice more complex Core Data scenarios using multiple managed object contexts, as well as using concurrency with Core Data. You will be modifying an existing codebase to be more performant and correct. To prepare for many of these changes, you'll [_refactor_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) your code, meaning you'll restructure it so that it's functionality can be updated without compromising its readability and maintainability.

The instructions for this project are intentionally somewhat less detailed that previous instructions this week. This project will require you to think about and understand how to architect your app to use multiple contexts and concurrency correctly. As always, follow the 20-minute rule, but don't be afraid to ask for help as you work.

## Instructions

Use the Journal project you made yesterday. Create a new branch called `day4`. When you finish today's instructions and go to make a pull request, be sure to select the original repository's `day4` branch as the base branch, and your own `day4` branch as the compare branch.

### Part 0 - Troubleshooting

Before starting, run your app with the `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` launch argument. Excercise all functions of the app and note whether any Core Data concurrency assertions are triggered. Were any triggered (ie. did the app crash)? If so, why? Today you'll fix these problems while simultaneously improving the overall performance of the app.

### Part 1 - Refactor to Prepare for Multiple Contexts

Start by refactoring some of your code to be better prepared to switch to using a separate managed object context for syncing operations.

1. Make your `fetchSingleEntry` method accept a `context` argument that it uses to fetch from.
2. Change your convenience initalizer for creating an `Entry` from an `EntryRepresentation` to accept a context in which to create the new `Entry`.
3. Extract the code responsible for iterating through the array of fetched `EntryRepresentation`s and updating or creating corresponding `Tasks`. Put it in a function that takes a context.
4. Update code that calls these functions to supply a context. For now, that should continue to be the main context you've used so far.
5. Test your app to be sure your refactoring hasn't broken anything.

### Part 2 - Use Concurrency APIs to Ensure Correctness

Even though you haven't yet updated your code to use multiple contexts, you can prepare for that by using Core Data's concurrency APIs to ensure that regardless of context, your code is concurrency-safe. Core Data is designed in such a way that you can write concurrency-correct code without having to keep track of and maintain dispatch queues, etc. yourself.

Remember that **any** use of managed objects or a managed object context must be done in a `perform` or `performAndWait` call for non-main-queue contexts. Even for main-queue contexts, it is safe and valid to use `perform` or `performAndWait`.

1. Go through each function that deals with managed objects. Decide whether it should ensure concurrency correctness itself, or whether responsibility for correctness should be left up to its caller. 
2. Update each function to do its work using `perform()` or `performAndWait()` on the appropriate context.
3. Run your app with the `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` launch argument. Excercise all functions of the app and verify that no Core Data concurrency assertions are triggered (ie. the app shouldn't crash).

### Part 3 - Use a Background Context for Syncing

1. Update your `fetchEntriesFromServer(...)` method so that it creates a new background context, and does all Core Data work on this context. It should update/create tasks from the fetched data on this context.
2. Save the context only after the update/creation process is complete. Remember that `save()` itself must be called on the context's private queue using `perform()` or `performAndWait()`.
3. In your `CoreDataStack`, after creating the container, set its `viewContext`'s `automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent` property to true. This is required for the `viewContext` (ie. the main context) to be updated with changes saved in a background context. In this case, the `viewContext`'s parent is the persistent store (coordinator), **not** another context.

### Part 4 - Testing

Thoroughly test your app to be sure that all features continue to function correctly. From an end user perspective, the app should behave **exactly** as it did yesterday. While you're testing the app, be sure the `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1` launch argument is set. Verify that no Core Data multithreading assertions are triggered.

## Go Further

If you'd like a further challenge, try using a separate managed object context in the detail view controller. This managed object context can be used a scratchpad, so that operations on the task being created/edited occur in it, and are only saved to the main context after the user taps the Save button. You can make the detail view controller's context a child of the main context. You can also use one of the other multiple managed object context setups. Because you can not "switch" which context an object instance is in, you'll need to use `NSManagedObjectID` and related APIs to communicate to the detail view controller which task it should be displaying/editing.

Just like yesterday, try to solidify today's concepts by starting over and rewriting the project from where you started today. Or even better, try to write the entire project with both today and yesterday's content from scratch. Use these instructions as sparingly as possible to help you practice recall.
